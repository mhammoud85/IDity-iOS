## 🔑 Request a Client Key
To use the IDity library in your project, you must obtain a **Client Key**. 
Please contact **[mhammoud85@hotmail.com](mailto:mhammoud85@hotmail.com)** to get your credentials before starting your integration.

## 📦 Installation

### Swift Package Manager (SPM)
1. In Xcode, go to **File > Add Packages...**
2. Enter the following repository URL:
   `https://github.com/mhammoud85/IDity-iOS.git`
3. Set the dependency rule to the latest version or branch.

**Minimum Deployment Target:** iOS 15.6

---

## ⚙️ Required Configuration

You must add the camera permission key to your app's **Info.plist**. Without this, the application will crash when the SDK attempts to scan a document.

| Key | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NSCameraUsageDescription** | "We need camera access to scan your ID or Passport for identity verification." |

### Supported Languages
The SDK automatically detects and supports the following languages based on the device settings:
* **English** 🇺🇸
* **French** 🇫🇷
* **Arabic** 🇱🇧

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Initialize the SDK
Initialize the SDK in your `AppDelegate`. You can pass a `tintColor` to match the SDK's UI elements (buttons, icons, and progress bars) to your app's branding.

```swift
import IDity

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    
    // Initialize the library
    IDitySDK.initialize(
        clientKey: "YOUR_CLIENT_KEY", 
        tintColor: .systemRed
    )
    
    return true
}
```

### 2. Start the Journey
Generate a unique reference number for the session and trigger the SDK UI.

```swift
// Generate a unique reference number
let referenceNo = "\(UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString ?? "")-\(Date().timeIntervalSince1970)"

// Start the verification process
IDitySDK.startJourney(
    from: self, 
    referenceNumber: referenceNo, 
    delegate: self
)
```

## 📩 Handling Results (IDityJourneyCallbacks)

Conform to the IDityJourneyCallbacks protocol to handle the lifecycle and results of the verification process.

```swift
extension YourViewController: IDityJourneyCallbacks {

    /// Called when the SDK successfully initializes and the UI appears
    func onJourneyStarted(journey: Int) {
        print("Identity journey \(journey) has started.")
    }

    /// Called when the document scanning and verification is successful
    func onJourneyCompleted(infoObject: IDity.InfoObject) {
        // Access extracted data
        print("First Name: \(infoObject.firstName ?? "N/A")")
        print("Last Name: \(infoObject.lastName ?? "N/A")")
    }

    /// Called when the user manually closes the SDK before completion
    func onJourneyCancelled() {
        print("User cancelled the verification process.")
    }

    /// Called if an error occurs during the journey
    func onError(error: any Error) {
        print("IDity Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```
